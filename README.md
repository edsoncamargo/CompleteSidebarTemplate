**ec-navigation-suite** is an Angular library that provides three navigation components: `sidebar`, `navbar`, and `accordion`. This suite of components aims to simplify the implementation of common navigation patterns in Angular applications.

## Technology

The following are the key technologies and tools used in the development of this app:

- **Angular**: A powerful front-end framework for building web applications.

## Components

### Sidebar

In the "About Me" section, you'll find a comprehensive introduction that provides insights into my background, passions, goals, and what drives me professionally.

### Navbar

The "Hobbies" section offers a glimpse into my interests and favorite pastime activities. Discover what I do outside of work and how I maintain a work-life balance.

### Accordion

Feel free to reach out to me in the "Contacts" section. Whether you want to discuss a project, network, or simply connect, I'm always open to engaging with others in the professional world.
